<h2 id="About-this-tutorial">About this tutorial<a class="anchor-link" href="#About-this-tutorial">&#182;</a></h2><p>This tutorial is a hands-on introduction to machine learning for beginners.</p>
<p>Getting started with machine learning can be quite difficult when you're randomly looking for information on the web.</p>
<p>Here, my goal is to help you with a concrete example of image recognition, with just a little bit of code, and no maths.</p>
<p>After a short introduction to machine learning, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>the principles of supervised machine learning for classification,</li>
<li>how to install the whole scientific python suite,</li>
<li>how to access and validate the training data for your network,</li>
<li>how to create and train your network</li>
<li>how to use the trained and test its performance.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prerequisites">&#182;</a></h4><p>We will work in python, which is a wonderful choice for data science. If you're not a python developer but know a bit of C, C++ or Java for example, you'll be fine. That will be an excellent occasion to to discover python. And, who knows, you could even fall in love with this language too!</p>

<h2 id="Why-machine-learning?">Why machine learning?<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-machine-learning?">&#182;</a></h2><p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence in which a system is designed to learn automatically given a set of input data. After the system has learnt (we say that the system has been trained), we can use it to make predictions for new data, unseen before.</p>
<p>This approach makes it possible to solve complex problems which are difficult or impossible to solve with traditional sequential programming.</p>
<p>Examples of machine learning applications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>autonomous cars: given the data from sensors like cameras and radars, the car is trained to drive on its own. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsaES--OTzM">The one of google still needs to learn about the right lane</a> ;-) </li>
<li>drones: the drone pilot only needs to give simple instructions (up, down, left, right, or just 3D coordinates), and the drone automatically performs complex adjustments to keep stability, or to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnTQTm7vNbY">fly in formation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LikxFZZO2sk">robots</a> </li>
<li>predicting real estate price from a set of variables like location, number of rooms, and even the text of the real estate ad. I'll certainly do a tutorial about that in the near future.</li>
<li>google ads that predict the probability for you to be interested in a given ad to send you the most promising ones</li>
<li>collaborative recommendation systems that give you the youtube videos or amazon products you will like</li>
<li>defect identification on production chains</li>
<li>identification of clusters of like-minded people on the social networks, and of the most important influencers within these groups</li>
<li>tagging photos (just type cat or food in the search box of your google photos library if you have one)</li>
<li>translation systems like <a href="https://translate.google.fr/?hl=en">google translate</a></li>
<li>spam email filtering</li>
<li>automatically generate paintings: <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/#gallery">deep dream</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alexjc/neural-doodle">neural doodle</a></li>

<h2 id="Machine-learning-for-classification">Machine learning for classification<a class="anchor-link" href="#Machine-learning-for-classification">&#182;</a></h2><p>Let's get a feel for how a neural network can be trained for classification.</p>
<p>In this post, our goal is to get started hands on with machine learning fast and easy, so I'm only going to give you a simplified explanation for now. There will be a more detailed post about the training principles later on, so stay tuned if you're interested.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/cbernet/maldives/raw/master/handwritten_digits_sklearn/supervised_learning.png" alt="Supervised learning"></p>
<p>The network is presented with a succession of training examples. Each training example consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the image of a digit</li>
<li>a label, which tells us which digit the image truly represents. For a given image, the label could be told to us by the person who wrote the digit in the first place. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the drawing above, the first image is processed by the neural network, which produces an answer: this is a 9.</p>
<p>At first, the connections between the neurons in the network are random, and the network is not able to do anything useful. It just provides a random answer.</p>
<p>The answer is compared to the label. In this case, the answer (9) is different from the label (the digit is actually a 3), and some feedback is given to the neural network so that it can improve. The connections between the neurons are modified, favoring the ones that tend to give a correct answer.</p>
<p>After the modification, the next examples are considered, and the neural network learns in an iterative process.</p>
<p>The number of training examples needed to train the network properly could be of the order of a few hundred for networks with a simple architecture, and millions for complex networks.</p>
<h2 id="Installing-python-and-its-scientific-library">Installing python and its scientific library<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installing-python-and-its-scientific-library">&#182;</a></h2><p><strong>if you're already running this tutorial in your jupyter notebook, please skip this section.</strong></p>
<p>We will use a variety of tools from <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a>, the scientific python library:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>: one of leading machine-learning toolkits for python. It will provide an easy access to the handwritten digits dataset, and allow us to define and train our neural network in a few lines of code</li>
<li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>: core package providing powerful tools to manipulate data arrays, such as our digit images</li>
<li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>: visualization tools, essential to check what we are doing</li>
<li><a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a>: the web server that will allow you to follow this tutorial and run the code directly in your web browser. </li>
</ul>
<p>Scipy is actually not a single library, but an "ecosystem" of interdependent python packages.</p>
<p>This ecosystem is full of snakes and beasts fighting survival -- you do not want to hang in there alone.</p>
<p>And indeed, six years ago, when I first got started with scipy, I tried to install manually all the packages I needed on top of the version of python already installed on my system.</p>
<p>I spent almost a day fighting against conflicting dependencies for these packages. For example, scikit-learn might need numpy version A, but pandas needs numpy version B. Or, one of these packages requires a version of python more recent than the one you have, meaning that you need to install an additional version of python and deal with your two versions later on.</p>
<p>And then, I discovered <a href="https://anaconda.org/">Anaconda</a>.</p>
<p>As stated on Anaconda's website:</p>
<p><em>With over 6 million users, the open source Anaconda Distribution is the fastest and easiest way to do Python and R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. It's the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.</em></p>
<p>In a nutshell, the anaconda team maintains a repository of more than 1400 data science packages, all compatible, and provides tools to install a version of python and these packages at the push of a button, and under five minutes.</p>
<p>Let's do it now!</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">download anaconda</a> for your system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the python 2.X version, not the 3.X version.</li>
<li>If you're using Windows or Linux, make sure to pick the 64 bit installer if you have a 64 bit system. </li>
</ul>
<p>Run the installer, and finally start the Anaconda Navigator. On windows, you can find it by clicking the windows start button, and typing anaconda.</p>
<p>In the Anaconda Navigator window, click on the Home tab, and launch the jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>Create a new notebook. In your notebook, you should see an empty cell, where you can write python code. Copy-paste the following lines, and execute the cell by pressing shift + enter.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s1">&#39;hello world!&#39;</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">i</span>
</pre></div>
<p>A new cell appears. Import numpy and matplotlib (remember that you need to execute the cell):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">plt</span> 
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is a standard way to import these modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pyplot module of matplotlib is called plt in this context</li>
<li>the numpy module is called np </li>
</ul>
<p>You can very well choose other names, but these ones are used by almost everybody, so it's easier to use them as well.</p>
<p>Now let's try and do our first plot, just to make sure that numpy and matplotlib are working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># create a numpy 1-D array with 16 evenly spaced values, from 0 to 3.</span>
<span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">linspace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">x</span> 
<span class="c1"># create a new numpy array. </span>
<span class="c1"># x**2 means that each element of x is squared.</span>
<span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">**</span><span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">y</span>
<span class="c1"># plot y versus x, you should get a parabola. </span>
<span class="c1"># check that for x = 1 we have y = 1, and that for x = 2, y = 4. </span>
<span class="n">plt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<hr>
<p>💡 <strong>A word of caution:</strong></p>
<p>It is very easy to get lost in the documentation of all these tools, and to waste a lot of time.</p>
<p>For example, if you check the documentation of the plt.plot method (I won't give you the link ;-) but you could google it), you will see that there are lots of ways to call it, with many optional parameters. But after all, do we need to know more than this: <code>plt.plot(x,y)</code> plots y vs x ?</p>
<p>If you want to have fun, I suggest to follow this tutorial until the end without digging deeper.</p>
<p>You'll train your first neural net easily and in the process, you'll get an understanding of the most important scikit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib tools. That's more than enough for a variety of machine learning tasks, and you can always learn more about specific features of these tools when you need them later on (you'll know!)</p>
<p>To go further, here's an excellent <a href="https://scipy-lectures.org/">scipy lecture</a>.</p>

<p>Now that you have access to the jupyter notebook, I have good news. You won't need to keep copy-pasting code from this page to your notebook.</p>
<p>Instead, just do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cbernet/maldives/archive/master.zip">download the repository containing this notebook</a></li>
<li>unzip it, say to <code>Downloads/maldives-master</code></li>
<li>launch a jupyter notebook from the anaconda navigator</li>
<li>in the notebook, navigate to <code>Downloads/maldives-master/handwritten_digits_sklearn</code></li>
<li>open <code>handwritten_digits_sklean.ipynb</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You should see this page appear in the notebook. From now on, follow the tutorial in the notebook. You should execute the cells as they come, or execute them all in one go. You can even add cells or modify existing cells to experiment a bit.</p>

<p>you can have a look at the next digits by calling <code>plot_multi(16)</code>, <code>plot_multi(32)</code>, etc. You will probably see that with such a low resolution, it's quite difficult to recognize some of the digits, even for a human. In these conditions, our neural network will also be limited by the low quality of the input images. Can the neural network perform at least as well as a human? It would already be an achievement!</p>

<p>With <a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>, creating, training, and evaluating a neural network can be done with only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We will make a very simple neural network, with three layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>an input layer, with 64 nodes, one node per pixel in the input images. Nodes are neurons that actually do nothing. They just take their input value and send it to the neurons of the next layer</li>
<li>a hidden layer with 15 neurons. We could choose a different number, and also add more hidden layers with different numbers of neurons</li>
<li>an output layer with 10 neurons corresponding to our 10 classes of digits, from 0 to 9. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <em>dense</em> neural network, which means that each node in each layer is connected to all nodes in the previous and next layers.</p>

<li>How to investigate about your input dataset,</li>
<li>How to train a neural network for image recognition, reaching an accuracy larger than 90% for digit classification.</li>

<p>It's only the beginning! In future posts we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>see if we can optimize our network to further increase the accuracy,</li>
<li>use deep learning (much more complex networks) to reach extreme accuracies,</li>
<li>dive a bit more into the mechanism of the training to understand why we have created the neural network with these parameters.</li>
