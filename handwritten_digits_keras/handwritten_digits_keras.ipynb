    "## About this tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "In my post about [handwritten digit recognition with scikit-learn](https://thedatafrog.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-scikit-learn/), we have seen that a simple neural network can easily be trained with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org). And we managed to classify images of digits with an accuracy larger than 90%. \n",
    "\n",
    "But scikit-learn is generally not adapted to neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its goal is in fact to provide a unified interface for training and testing different machine learning algorithms: neural networks, and also support-vector machines, naive Bayes, nearest neighbours, decision trees, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in machine learning projects, you'll spend a large fraction of your time choosing the best algorithm and tuning it for best performance. Scikit-learn was designed to make these tasks as easy as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when it comes to neural networks specifically, scikit-learn has two major drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the interface does not provide enough control to build complex neural networks, nor to control their behaviour in details.\n",
    "* it's not adapted to [deep learning](https://thedatafrog.com/install-tensorflow-windows/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we will repeat our exercise about handwritten digit recognition with [Keras](https://keras.io/), a high-level neural networks API. You will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to install Keras \n",
    "* How to create a simple dense neural network with this tool \n",
    "* How to estimate its performance \n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, we will use Keras as an interface to TensorFlow to do deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** You should have some knowledge of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* numpy, \n",
    "* matplotlib, \n",
    "* jupyter notebooks,\n",
    "* basic neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
